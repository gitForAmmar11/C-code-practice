Welcome to my **C Programming code practice** repository! This repository contains a collection of C codes, organized from basic to advanced levels, covering a wide range of fundamental and functional concepts of the C language.

This repository is intended to help beginners and intermediate learners understand the core concepts of C programming. It includes simple examples and programs covering:

- Basic Input/Output
- Arithmetic Operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus)
- Control Structures (if, if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays (1D and 2D)
- Functions (with and without return values, with and without arguments)
- Strings (handling and manipulation)
- File Handling (read, write, append)
- Pointer basics
